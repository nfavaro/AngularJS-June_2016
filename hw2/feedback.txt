Good Job Nick! Look good man, some notes below.

- Good job on using ng-repeat for the folder radio buttons.
	<span ng-repeat="folder in ctrl.folders"><br>
	    <label>
	        <input type="radio" ng-model="ctrl.selectedFolder" ng-value="folder">
	        <span ng-bind="folder.name"></span>
	    </label>
	</span>

- Nice use of eS6 with the (...files), be careful with this on different browsers.

- You want to avoid this kind of logic in the html...
	
	ng-disabled="!ctrl.taskName||!ctrl.taskDescription||!ctrl.taskPriority"

	you can define a property in your model and update its value when the other properties change using the ng-change directive.


 - For radio buttons, if you just want to use a hard-coded value you can just value instead of ng-value

 	<input type="radio" ng-model="ctrl.taskPriority" ng-value="'high'">

 	becomes

 	<input type="radio" ng-model="ctrl.taskPriority" value="high">


 Overall Great Job.
