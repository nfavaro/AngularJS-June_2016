- good job on waiting until the end to generate the list of songs.
- for objects that don't have any functions on the prototype, it's a little overkill to generate a factory.

	eg: 
	.factory('Song', function () {
	    function Song(title) {
	        this.title = title;
	    }

	    return Song;
	})

	I would just use the standard object creation syntax:
		{
			title: title
		}
