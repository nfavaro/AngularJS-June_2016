Great job Nick, some notes below:

- Nice use of ES6 :)
- I would make the average/grade/pass part of the AssignmentList factory.  These properties could be used by other parts of the application.
- Be careful when using self.assignmentList.removeAssignment(index); when passing the index from the html.  It works in this case, but there will be cases we'll talk about when it doesn't work
	An alternative is to pass the assignmnet and calculate the index using indexOf
	eg var index = this.assignments.indexOf(myAssignment);

- Good job!
